1)No_accident_flight_plots:
Approach:
#First we need to understand the constraints and requirements, such as the number of flights and the format of coordinates.
#Choosing matplotlib library for plotting the flight paths. Selected this library for its ease of use and flexibility in plotting 2D graphs.
#Plot the flight paths using different colors to distinguish between different flights
#Selecting 'shapely' library for geometric calculations to check for intersections and Converting the flight paths into geometric objects (LineString) and check for intersections between paths.
#Integrate the plotting and intersection checking into a single function.
#Print messages if any intersections are detected between flight paths.
